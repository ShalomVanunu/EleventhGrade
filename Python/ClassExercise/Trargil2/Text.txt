About the extension
---------------

This extension allow you to view and manipulate the actual data that sent via whatsapp.
1) Open chrome developer tool and break on keyPair: t, (line 3311) and wait until the keys will appear (5 minutes or so).
2) Run the decoder server which is `parser.py` (in helper dir).
3) Install `burpWhatsapp.py` to your burp suite extensions.
4) Break get the keys from step 1.
5) get the secret parameter from the websocket in burp websocket history.

Functionality
---------------

1) Decrypt incoming data, you have to paste the data as base64 to the extension `ctrl+b`
2) Encrypt incoming data, after you decrypt the data you can encrypt and put it back to burp by copy pase the base64 and `ctrl+shift+b`
3) Decrypt outgoing data, to decrypt outgoing data you have to take it from `AesCbcEncrypt` function in list format.
4) Encrypt outgoing data, after the extension encrypt the data back you have to put it back via the console.

you can use the following helper function to do that:

```js
function str2unit8(str) {
  var buf = new ArrayBuffer(str.length);
  var bufView = new Uint8Array(buf);

  for (var i=0, strLen=str.length; i < strLen; i++) {
    bufView[i] = str[i];
  }
  return buf;
}
```

TO-DO
---------------

The extension currently can decrypt and encrypt only the message related functionality, in order to add more function you have to map the protobuf
and add it to our protobuf file.
